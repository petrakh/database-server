# database-server

## The brief

## PRACTICE TECH TEST - MAKERS ACADEMY, DAY 1
You receive a message from a prospective employer:

"Before your interview, write a program that runs a server that is accessible on http://localhost:4000/. When your server receives a request on http://localhost:4000/set?somekey=somevalue it should store the passed key and value in memory. When it receives a request on http://localhost:4000/get?key=somekey it should return the value stored at somekey. Store the data in memory, not in a database, but bear in mind that you will later need to add a database to this code."

## Installation instructions
git clone https://github.com/petrakh/database-server.git
brew install node
npm install mocha chai request
